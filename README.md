# Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) scheme demonstration

## Objectives

Present **permutation-based SCMA** encoding/decoding algorithms for use in the researches of new schemes for 5G telecommunication standard.

## Description

* Codebooks are from [presentation](http://www.innovateasia.com/5g/images/pdf/1st%205G%20Algorithm%20Innovation%20Competition-ENV1.0%20-%20SCMA.pdf)

* PDA algorithm is used

* Log-MPA for conventional SCMA scheme


## Running

Run script 

## Research

Investigating the rotation angle of codebook design
